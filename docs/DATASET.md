**UCFCrime** dataset can be reached from [here](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/projects/real-world/) or from the [repo](https://github.com/WaqasSultani/AnomalyDetectionCVPR2018).


We preprocess the videos with [3DCNN](https://github.com/kenshohara/3D-ResNets-PyTorch) models. Preprocessing code can be found in the autoencoder folder.
